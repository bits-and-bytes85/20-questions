# 20-questions

QuestionsMain.java runs a game of 20 questions, where the user thinks of a mystery object, and the computer tries to guess the object by asking a series of yes or no questions. If the computer fails to guess the object, it prompts the client to submit the object they were thinking of along with a yes or no question, which allows the computer to improve at the game over time.
